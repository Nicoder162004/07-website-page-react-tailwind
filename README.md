# Hero Section Component in React + Tailwind CSS

I have completed building a **Hero section** in React, fully styled with **Tailwind CSS** and powered via **props** for dynamic content.  
This project uses both **Atomic Design** and **Feature/Composition Design**, helping me build **scalable and maintainable UI components**.

## What I Learned and Implemented

- âœ… Using **props** to make components reusable and dynamic.
- âœ… Applying **Atomic Design**: breaking the UI into **atoms**, **molecules**, and **organisms**.
- âœ… Using **Feature/Composition Design** for better project organization and scalability.
- âœ… Leveraging **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling and responsive design.
- âœ… Improved understanding of **component reusability, modularity, and design patterns** in React.
